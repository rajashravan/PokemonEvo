# PokemonEvo

Python app (using the Flask framework) that gives you information on a given Pokemon (like a PokeDex)

*Note: the API can be a little slow at times and I haven't implemented a cache yet so give the app a few seconds to run after inputting your pokemon*

Instructions: (To be completed)

Download folder and cd into folder.
```
python app.py
```
