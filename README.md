# PokemonEvo

Python app (using the Flask framework) that gives you information on a given Pokemon (like a PokeDex)

*Note: the API can be a little slow at times and I haven't implemented a cache yet so give the app a few seconds to run after inputting your pokemon*

Simply go to https://pokemon-evo.herokuapp.com to run! Note - I am using the free tier of Heroku so the site may be experiencing downtime, or I may have run out of active apps and deactivated it. 


Instructions to run locally : (To be completed)

Download folder and cd into folder.
```
python app.py
```
go to http://localhost:5000

Made with the open-source PokeAPI: https://pokeapi.co/

Used Bootstrap for styling.
